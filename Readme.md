# A confusing repo!?

The mysteriously named csv files in this repo are actually from a study on telling people jokes and showing them funny images.
They had to rate how funny they found these jokes and images.
The data also have some additional variables that we collected.
Some of the variables differ between the csv files because we decided to change some variables in between.
But some we kept the same.
Also, be careful, the top 2 rows of the files seem a bit messed up.
If only I knew R! Then I could probably analyze this data by stacking them together and analyzing the study results.
